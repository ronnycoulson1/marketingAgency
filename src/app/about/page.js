              My name is Ronny, and Iâ€™ve always dreamed of running a software
              business. My journey started as a kid fascinated with coding. I
              pursued a degree in Computer Science at Kent State University and
              gained valuable experience working for a home improvement company
              in the marketing department and door-to-door sales. Through these
              experiences, I developed a passion for helping businesses
              communicate and solve their challenges effectively.
